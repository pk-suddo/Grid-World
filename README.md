# Grid-World
A Python-based grid world simulation where a player navigates a 2D grid encountering a leaf obstacle. The simulation allows the leaf to be either passable or an obstacle that can be pushed, showcasing simple AI or pathfinding concepts through object-oriented programming.


Project Description
This project is a Python-based simulation of an agent navigating through a grid world, encountering obstacles that can either be bypassed or moved. It serves as an introductory tool for understanding basic concepts in artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on agent movement and interaction with the environment.

Features
Configurable Grid Size: Users can adjust the dimensions of the grid to experiment with different world sizes.
Agent Navigation: The agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right, demonstrating fundamental navigational logic.
Obstacle Interactions: The simulation includes two types of obstacles, passable and movable, to illustrate different challenges an agent may face.

Installation
To run this simulation, ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. No additional libraries or dependencies are required, simplifying setup and execution.
