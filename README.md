# Grid-World
A Python-based grid world simulation where a player navigates a 2D grid encountering a leaf obstacle. The simulation allows the leaf to be either passable or an obstacle that can be pushed, showcasing simple AI or pathfinding concepts through object-oriented programming.


Grid World Simulation README
Overview
A simple Python script for a grid world simulation where an agent navigates around obstacles. Made for an AI class project to demonstrate basic agent movements and interactions.

Setup
Requires Python 3.x. Download the script and run it with Python.

bash
python world_simulation.py

Customize the simulation by editing the script's WorldSimulation object parameters for grid size and obstacle behavior.
